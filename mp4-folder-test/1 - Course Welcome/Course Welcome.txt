Welcome to our course on preformulation within our series entitled Drug Hunting: The Science of Making New Medicines. The early stages of drug discovery emphasize the testing of new compounds through in vitro assays. In this course, we will focus on how preformulation scientists prepare active compounds into formulation suitable for dosing into more complex animal studies. Preformulation research is critically important as it forms the basis for the eventual final market formulation that patients will use. If not done correctly, this can lead to time-consuming and expensive delays as a drug advances through clinical studies. Through a combination of instructional videos, selected readings, and assessment activities, class participants will gain insight into the most important factors that guide preformulation.
